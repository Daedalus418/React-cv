# Personal website :rocket: :sparkles:

Hello ! Thanks to be there !

This website is a personal project.
I wanted to learn new skills like preprocessor and ReactJS and apply my knowledge.

## Requirements

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Execution

### Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Daedalus418/React-cv.git
cd React-cv
npm install
```
### Development

```bash
npm start
```
### Production

```bash
```
## What I used

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) because I'm not a web designer
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for icons
- [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) overkill for this project but I wanted to learn by starting a simple project.


Let me know what you think !
